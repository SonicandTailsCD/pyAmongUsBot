# pyAmongUsBot
An Among Us bot made with Python 3.6. This python script is intended to run on a phone.
To use this script, you must:
1.- Install scrcpy
2.- Enable USB debugging on your phone
3.- Use a Windows-based PC.
4.- Make sure your PC's powerful enough.
5.- Close all active programs as they can interfere with the script.
6.- If your phone's a low-end phone run scrcpy with --max-fps=30 as that can improve performance (Supported officially in Android 10 - may work on older Android OS)
